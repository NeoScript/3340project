# MIPS Assembler

This project uses MIPS Assembly Language in order to assemble MIPS instructions into their proper binary format so that it can be read by the MIPS processor/simulator and execute the instructions. Open up the "assembler.asm" file and point your file to assemble by changing the 'file_location:' variable.  Pass in a file to test with a ".asm" extension. Now go ahead and run the program. You should end up with a 'test.txt' that contains all of the code you wrote in MIPS.

the output of will be rows of 32bit binary strings

ex:

00000001001011110111000000100011

00000001000010100101100000100010
