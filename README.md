# MIPS Assembler

Project Description
This project uses MIPS Assembly Language in order to assemble MIPS instructions into their proper binary format so that it can be read by the MIPS processor/simulator and execute the instructions. Open up the "assembler.asm" file and point your file to assemble by changing the 'file_location:' variable.  Pass in a file to test with a ".asm" extension. Now go ahead and run the program. You should end up with a 'test.txt' that contains all of the code you wrote in MIPS.
